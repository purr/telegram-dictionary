# Telegram Dictionary Bot üìö

A Telegram bot that works in inline mode to lookup definitions of words in public dictionaries.

## Features

- **Inline Mode**: Works in any chat by typing `@your_bot_name` followed by the word to lookup
- **Debounce Implementation**: Waits for the user to finish typing before searching
- **Multiple Dictionaries**: Looks up definitions in public dictionaries (currently Free Dictionary API)
- **Rich Results**: Returns formatted definitions with phonetics, meanings, examples, and more
- **Detailed View**: Clicking on results shows comprehensive information about the word
- **Error Handling**: Provides notifications if no word has been found

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- aiogram 3.3.0+
- python-dotenv
- requests

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/purr/telegram-dictionary.git
   cd telegram-dictionary
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create a Telegram bot using BotFather:

   - Open Telegram and search for `@BotFather` ü§ñ
   - Send `/newbot` command and follow the instructions
   - Once created, BotFather will give you a token
   - Enable inline mode for your bot by sending `/setinline` to BotFather
   - Set the inline placeholder text (e.g., "Type a word to lookup")

4. Create a `.env` file in the project directory and add your bot token:

   ```
   BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token_here
   ```

5. Run the bot:
   ```
   python run.py
   ```

## Usage

1. In any Telegram chat (including direct messages with the bot), type `@your_bot_name` followed by a space and the word you want to look up.

   Example: `@your_bot_name hello`

2. The bot will search for the definition of the word and display a brief preview.

3. Tap on the result to send the full definition to the chat.

4. For more detailed information, tap on the "Detailed information" option.

## How It Works

1. The bot monitors inline queries sent to it üì°
2. When a user types `@your_bot_name` followed by a word, it triggers an inline query
3. The bot waits for the user to finish typing (using a debounce technique) ‚å®Ô∏è
4. It then looks up the word in the Free Dictionary API üîé
5. If a definition is found, it formats and returns it as an inline result ‚úÖ
6. If no definition is found, it notifies the user ‚ùå
